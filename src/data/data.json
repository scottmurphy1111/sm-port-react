In my 15+ years of web development I have found few other peers who are so hard-working and determined to deliver quality results ahead of schedule. Scott is a constant learner... whether it’s at work or on a weekend, he displays a great curiosity about new tools and technologies and loves to work toward mastering them. He is what I would consider a “unicorn” in that he not only is able to grasp more complex technical concepts, but he cares deeply about the aesthetic and UX side of web development, and his commitment to pixel-perfect work makes him extremely popular among his design partners.",
