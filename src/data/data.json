In my 15+ years of web development I have found few other peers who are so <strong>hard-working and determined</strong> to deliver quality results ahead of schedule.<br /><br />Scott is a constant learner... whether it’s at work or on a weekend, he displays a great curiosity about new tools and technologies and loves to work toward mastering them. He is what I would consider a “unicorn” in that he not only is able to grasp more complex technical concepts, but <strong>he cares deeply about the aesthetic</strong> and UX side of web development, and his commitment to pixel-perfect work makes him extremely popular among his design partners.",

I have had the pleasure of working with Scott from day one of my time at Capital One. He's the ideal teammate. He’s a team player and puts in the work and then some. He’s very easy to talk to and very understanding. Everyone loves working with him, including myself.<br /><br />He’s been my go-to guy for when I needed help on a specific task and he’s always willing to help. His technical ability and <strong>his knack for solving complex problems never ceases to amaze me</strong>. He’s the ideal tech lead. He’s always open to help out when you need him, he drops everything he’s working on to help you solve your problem, and he’s a <strong>fantastic teacher</strong>. He’s been a great mentor through it all and I continue to learn from him day in and day out. I can’t wait to see what is in store for him in the future because he’s capable of anything he puts his mind to.",
